## Future extensions

*1.* The kid's Christmas wish list is currently saved in a database for parents to access with their login, but in the future we want the kid's wishlist to automatically be sent to the parents email inbox on submit of the list.

*2.* If a given parent has more than one kid, adding a view page where you can access each children's list through designated 'child name' tabs would be a convienent tool for parents to have for easy access.

*3.* Linking the site to amazon and other shopping sites would be very useful and time reducing for easy christmas present searching.

*4.* Adding a view page that has a child age filter and once the child age is selected, the site returns the top toys/gifts of the year for youth in that age range, and then the site pulls from the Amazon/shopping site view page and returns URL links to various sites sellign the product with the pricing for each site for efficient and financially smart shopping.
