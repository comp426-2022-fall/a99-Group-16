I, Davis, got together all the documentation and information needed to present our work in an organized and an easy-to-understand manner for any given reader.
## Design Lead: Raheel Qamar
Raheel worked with Grant on the ejs files for the design and layout of our site so that it fit the holiday theme associated with the Christmas list page view and sign up/log in page view.
## Git Hub Lead: Arvind Verelli
Arvind managed all of the updates by making sure that no one was editing in the same file when trying to commit. He kept files in order and made sure that our project files were readable and that the repository was easy to navigate so the rest of us could work at max efficiency without having any merge conflicts.
