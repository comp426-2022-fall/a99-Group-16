## *Plan*üìù
Our group met for a planning session on December 4th and tossed around ideas, assigned team roles, and figured out a work schedule that aligned with everyone's available time frames during final exam season. We originally came up with the idea to implement a grocery shopping list site to track what needs to be purchased on a trip to the ggrocery store, but we then converted this idea into making a site that allows any given kid to make a Christmas wish list of all the gifts they want from "Santa". When the kid's gift list is complete, they can click <img src = "https://img.shields.io/badge/-Deliver%20to%20the%20North%20Pole-red" /> and on submit of the click, the wish list will be saved to the database for the kid's parent to shop off of. We assigned team roles, and then got to work by starting on the back-end, front-end, and then implemented design along the way while documenting at the same time.
